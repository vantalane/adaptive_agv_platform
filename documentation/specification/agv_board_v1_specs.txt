PCBA power:
	Battery voltage range: 8.5V - 15V
	Supply current abs max: 20A
	Supply current typical max: 15.2A

	Note: Power supplied by USB-C only powers the microcontrollers and certain current measurement IC's.
 
Safety:
	Emergency stop: A male XT-60 connector is used to pass-through power supplied by a battery. A normally-closed high current emergency stop button should be used to short the terminals of connector J25. If this isn't connected, the battery will be practically "disconnected".
 

Motor drivers:
	Supply current: 5A absolute max, 3,8A typical max

	
Motor current measurement:
	Measured until 5A max
	Voltage per Amp ratio: 1 V/A
	Vcurrent frequency cutoff: 795.77 Hz

Battery voltage measurement:
	Voltage divider ratio: 0.3377
		Example: Battery is 13.89 volts, Atmega ADC measures 13.89*0.3377=4.69V
