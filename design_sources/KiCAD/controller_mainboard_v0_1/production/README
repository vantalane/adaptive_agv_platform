6-
Add bom file: bom.csv
Add CPL file: positions.csv
Go to next page after upload.

7- 
Most necessary parts should be automatically automatically selected. If certain parts are out of stock, and therefore are automatically not selected, alternative parts will need to be provided.
In this case, contact an experienced EE or me (m.keskin@student.fontys.nl or mete@kestech.net) for support.

All, EXCEPT for the following should be selected:
*XT-60 AMASS CONNECTOR J2,J25
