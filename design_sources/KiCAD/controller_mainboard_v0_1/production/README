Order instructions for FONTYS.

PCB is designed with part availability of LCSC and Tinytronics.
The PCB will be assembled by using JLC PCBA service, the order procedure is similar to ordering only PCB's, but with some additions to it.

Steps

1- 
Load the controller_mainboard.zip on the jlcpcb order page.

2- 
From top to bottom, select the following settings:
base material: FR4
layers: 4
Dimensions are automatically filled (200x100mm)
QTY: 5 (This version 0.1 is deemed a prototype, therefore should always be validated before larger orders (a.k.a, buy the V1 largescale))
product type: industrial/consumer

different design: 1
Delivery format: single pcb
thickness: 1.6mm
color: (up to you, green is cheapest and fastest, but purple fits Fontys theme)
Silk: white
Materiel type: FR4-std TG 135-140
Surface finish: LeadFree HASL

Outer copper weight: 1oz
inner copper weight: 0.5oz
Layer sequence: yes
	L1 - controller_mainboard-F_Cu.gtl
	L2 - controller_mainboard-In1_Cu.g1
	L3 - controller_mainboard-In2_Cu.g2
	L4 - controller_mainboard-B_Cu.gbl
Specify stackup: yes - JLC04161H-7628
Via covering: plugged
Min via diameter: 0.3mm/(0.4/0.45mm)
Outline tolerance: regular
Confirm prod file: No
Mark on PCB: Order number
Gold Fingers: no
Castellated hole:no
pressfit hole: no
edge plating: no
Blind slots: no

3- 
Select "PCB Assembly" by using the button.

Fill in the following settings for PCB assembly:

PCBA type: Eco
Assembly side: Top
PCBA QTY: 2
Tooling holes: JLCPCB
Confirm part placement: Yes
Stencil storage: no 
Fixture Storage: no
Parts Selection: customer

*Dont fill in advanced options*
*ignore stencil*

4- 
Proceed by clicking on the "NEXT" button

5-
Now you should get a render of the PCB, proceed by clicking next
*photo here*

6-
Add bom file: bom.csv
Add CPL file: positions.csv
Go to next page after upload.

7- 
Most necessary parts should be automatically automatically selected. If certain parts are out of stock, and therefore are automatically not selected, alternative parts will need to be provided.
In this case, contact an experienced EE or me (m.keskin@student.fontys.nl or mete@kestech.net) for support.

All, EXCEPT for the following should be selected:
*XT-60 AMASS CONNECTOR J2,J25

Thus, at the top of the page you should have:
Total 40 parts detected, 35 parts confirmed, 10 parts not selected

The following are automatically not selected for assembly, 
J1
J7
J8 
J10,J4,J5,J6,J9
J11,J12,J13,J14
J16,J19
J18
J20,J21,J22,J23

Click on "NEXT" and after this "Do not place".

8- 
Now, a render of the PCB files should be displayed.

Select product description as - Research\Education\DIY\Entertainment > Robot - HS Code 847990

10- Pay



11- After JLC, there are certain parts that will be manually assembled onto the PCB. These are described in the "controller_board_v0_1.ods" spreadsheet file. Here, parts per PCB are described, order multiples of this set according to how many PCB's are going to be assembled.
