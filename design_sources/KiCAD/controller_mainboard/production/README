Order instructions for FONTYS.

PCB is designed with part availability of LCSC and Tinytronics.
The PCB will be assembled by using JLC PCBA service, the order procedure is similar to ordering only PCB's, but with some additions to it.

Steps

1- 
Load the controller_mainboard.zip on the jlcpcb order page.

2- 
From top to bottom, select the following settings:
base material: FR4
layers: 4
Dimensions are automatically filled (200x100mm)
QTY: 5 (This version 0.1 is deemed a prototype, therefore should always be validated before larger orders (a.k.a buy V1 largescale))
product type: industrial/consumer

different design: 1
Delivery format: single pcb
thickness: 1.6mm
color: (up to you, green is cheapest and fastest, but purple fits Fontys theme)
Silk: white
Materiel type: FR4-std TG 135-140
Surface finish: LeadFree HASL

Outer copper weight: 1oz
inner copper weight: 0.5oz
Layer sequence: yes
	L1 - controller_mainboard-F_Cu.gtl
	L2 - controller_mainboard-In1_Cu.g1
	L3 - controller_mainboard-In2_Cu.g2
	L4 - controller_mainboard-B_Cu.gbl
Specify stackup: yes - JLC04161H-7628
Via covering: plugged
Min via diameter: 0.3mm/(0.4/0.45mm)
Outline tolerance: regular
Confirm prod file: No
Mark on PCB: Order Number (Specify position)
Gold Fingers: no
Castellated hole:no
pressfit hole: no
edge plating: no
Blind slots: no

3- 
Select "PCB Assembly" by using the button.

Fill in the following settings for PCB assembly:

PCBA type: Eco
Assembly side: Top
PCBA QTY: 2
Tooling holes: JLCPCB
Confirm part placement: Yes
Stencil storage: no 
Fixture Storage: no
Parts Selection: customer

*Dont fill in advanced options*


4- 
Proceed by clicking on the "NEXT" button, (ignore stencil)

5-
Now you should get a render of the PCB, proceed by clicking next

6-
Add bom file: bom.csv
Add CPL file: positions.csv

7- 
Tick all the boxes on the right to confirm assembly of these parts

Except FOR the following:
*XT-60 AMASS CONNECTOR J2,J25
*

METE FIX!!
C5263892 - WRONG FOOTPRINT ON JLCNUMBER - JLC HAS THT, PCB HAS SMD
TPS5430DDA - MISMATCHING LCSC NUMBERS from SCH to LCSC
C78275 Y1-Y2 mismatching LCSC numbers MISMATCHIN

Diodes 40V5A have LCSC on sch, but not on exported files
J3 has LCSC but not on extorts
L4 has lcsc but not on export 
l2's have lcsc but not on extort

current resistors R25 etc don't have a lcsc in bom but has IRL
